The purpose of this repository is to contain a writing project. 

## Project Context 

{Replace this text}

## General Instructions

Treat this repository as your workspace. 

You can invoke MCPs in order to save versions of the text with outside services (Google, Notion, etc). But that activity will always be in addition to creating versions here: not instead of it. 

In addition to the above, the user adheres to the following preferences, which you should be careful to honor throughout your work:

### Create, Don't Edit 

The user may use you to assist with proofreading, editing, or other tasks. A key consideration will always be preservation of voice: the user will use to do things that you can do quicker and better than they can. But they are the author. Remember that they wish to leverage your help carefully and within carefully controlled parameters. 

Your edits should adhere precisely to those instruted limits. You should never do more even if you think that it would be helpful.

Your version control should be meticulous:

You should assume that the user always wishes that you create a new version of texts so that the original is preserved. By default, you will number drafts sequentially, using a prefix (_v1, v2).

The user may ask - if a working folder is becoming very cluttered - that you "archive" prior material. Or that earlier versions that they do not wish to maintain be deleted. To archive versions, move the texts into archive ensuring that they are archived within specifically named and identifiable subfolders. For deletions: do not warn, just delete. 

## Repository Lifecycle 

This repository may have a short lived lifecycle (a single blog post) or it may have a longer one (a book). It may be a periodically explored project: you may start by creating a blog post. The user might later return to spin it out into a generative AI podcast. 

For that reason, ascertain where things are "at" if it's not obvious. Keep a log of the project status in CLAUDE.md, above this section. 

## Headless CMS

When working with a headless CMS:

- Treat this repo as the workspace 
- Validate that the user has provided the correct and authenticated MCP 
- Push content as instructed or when the user is ready to publish. The drafting and research process will be carried out here. 

## Research And Notes 

The user will use research and notes to gather together source material. You may browse it when appropriate. 

## Images 

The user may also gather images in this repository with the intention of publishing them - or other binaries like video content - alongside the blog. 

You can assist with preparatory activities to that end including:

- Rewriting them with descriptive filenames 
- Standardising on a certain format 
- Creating versions for various aspect ratios 

A common request from the user might be to create an OG image,. This refers to Opengraph and is 1200x630px.

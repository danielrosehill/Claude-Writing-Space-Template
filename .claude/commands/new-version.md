# Create New Version

Launch the version-manager agent to create a new version of the current draft with specific edits.

This command is useful when you want to:
- Make targeted edits to a draft
- Apply proofreading changes
- Try alternative approaches while preserving the original
- Incorporate feedback while keeping version history

The agent will:
1. Identify the current version
2. Ask what changes you want to make
3. Create the next sequential version (e.g., v2 → v3)
4. Apply only the requested changes
5. Preserve your original voice and style

Usage: `/new-version`

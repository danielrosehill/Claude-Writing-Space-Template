# Proofread Current Draft

Launch the proofreader agent to fix errors in your current draft while preserving your voice.

This command will:
1. Ask which file you want proofread
2. Ask what type of edits you want (typos only, grammar, clarity, etc.)
3. Create a new version with only the requested corrections
4. Preserve your tone, style, and voice
5. Report what was changed

Common use cases:
- "Fix typos only"
- "Grammar and punctuation"
- "Speech-to-text errors"
- "Typos and awkward phrasing"

The proofreader will NEVER:
- Rewrite your sentences without permission
- Change your tone or voice
- Add content or expand ideas
- Make style changes you didn't request

Usage: `/proofread`

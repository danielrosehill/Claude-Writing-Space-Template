# Archive Old Versions

Launch the archive-manager agent to organize and clean up your workspace.

This command helps when:
- Your working directory has too many old versions
- You want to keep things organized but preserve history
- You're ready to archive drafts after publication
- You need to clean up before starting a new section

The agent will:
1. Review current workspace organization
2. Suggest what to archive (or ask your preference)
3. Create dated archive folders
4. Move old versions to archive
5. Keep your latest versions in the working directory

You can also use this for:
- Organizing research materials
- Cleaning up unused images
- Deleting files you no longer need

Usage: `/archive`
